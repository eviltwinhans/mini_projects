Various projects to learn Python, PyCharm, GitHub

## 1. Guesser
**File**: guesser.py

**Description**: the program generates a random number in the range from 1 to 100, then user should guess the number.
The program tells the user whether their guess is greater or less than the random number.

Project _ingredients_:
- Integers (type int);
- Variables;
- Data input and output: input() and print();
- Conditions: if/elif/else;
- Loops: while, infinite loops;
- Operators: break, continue;
- Modules: random.


## 2. Magic 8 Ball
**File**: magic8.py

**Description**: the program randomly chooses one of pre-generated answers to the question entered by a user.

## 3. Password Generator (light)
**File**: passgenerator.py

**Description**: the program randomly generates a required number of passwords
allowing a smart setting for the length of the password and for valid characters.
There is no enforcement of required symbols though.

Project _ingredients_:
- Integers (type int);
- Variables;
- Data input and output: input() and print();
- Conditions: if/elif/else;

## 4. Caesar Cypher
**File**: caesar.py

**Description**: the program encrypts or decrypts the text entered by the user using a Caesar cipher.
There are 3 modes: user can choose a certain shift for the whole text, they can check multiple results for a shift value,
or each word in the text may be encrypted with its own shift value equal to a word's length.

Project _ingredients_:
- Integers (type int);
- Modular arithmetic;
- Variables;
- Data input and output: input() and print();
- Conditions: if/elif/else;
- Loops: for, while;
- String methods.
